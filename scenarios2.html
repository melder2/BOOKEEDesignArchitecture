                            <p><strong>John - Scenario 1</strong></p>
                            <p>

                                <div id="indent">John has been asked by the CEO of the clinic where he works to help discuss ideas for the new appointment booking system. John wants a simple environment for both his receptionists and patients to be</div> <div id="indent">able to view the available appointments and to be able to book them.
                                John starts by asking his receptionists what kinds of tools or features that she would find useful for her work. He also gives people</div> <div id="indent">surveys to fill out while they are at the doctor office asking basic questions about an appointment booking software and what they would want to do with it. He also asks some of his friends and colleagues</div> <div id="indent">both in his field and in other fields about what kinds of appointment booking software they have and what features are available on their system.
                                John wants a simple application where he can login from </div> <div id="indent">the main screen, and it pops up with a calendar of appointments. He wants to know what the appointment is regarding (ex. Check up after surgery for knee surgery). He also wants to know who booked the</div> <div id="indent">appointment for managerial purposes. John also wants to only have his receptionists and patients only book appointments within a certain time period.</div>
                            </p>

                            <p><strong>John - Scenario 2</strong></p>
                            <p>

                            <div id="indent">John is talking with his receptionists in a team meeting about the possibility of purchasing or using a new appointment booking application. The receptionists are very open and responsive in what they want</div> <div id="indent"> to be able to do in the appointment booking software. Although, they also bring up important security requirements for the company to be able to use the software due to HIPAA.
                            The receptionists agree with</div> <div id="indent">John that they each need to have their own log in information. They also want the ability to mark out certain time frames due to lunch and other potential conflicts for the doctor or the receptionists. They want</div> <div id="indent">the ability to book appointments as far out as a year. The surgery scheduler wants to make her surgery appointments different than the other appointments and only on certain days. The final thing they want</div> <div id="indent">is the software to send out reminders two days prior to the appointment.</div>
                            </p>

                            <p><strong>John - Scenario 3</strong></p>
                            <p>
                            <div id="indent">The Louisville Orthopedic Clinic had a giant meeting with all of their patients to discuss what they would want in an appointment booking software. The clinic invited past, current, and future patients to this</div> <div id="indent">meeting to discuss potential features for the software. All of the patients are very excited because they thought the way the clinic currently does appointments is outdated and not helpful. The clinic proposes a</div> <div id="indent">couple of features and then lets the patients tell them what features they would be interested in with the patient perspective.
                            The patients all wanted to have an option to book appointments online, so they </div> <div id="indent">didn’t have to call every time they wanted an appointment. The patients also wanted the application to be secure. The patients wanted the ability to cancel through the app anytime before 24 hours of the</div> <div id="indent">appointment with no penalty and then within 24 hours with a penalty. They wanted the option to have their google or social media credentials to be used as their log in information, so they didn’t need to</div> <div id="indent">remember a new username and password. One patient said that they would like a customer satisfaction survey at the end of scheduling an appointment. The last thing they wanted was an appointment</div> <div id="indent">reminder two days in advance.</div>
