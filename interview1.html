                            <p>Interviewed on 1/19/2023 by Adam T. Winders</p>
                            <br><p>What is your background?</p>
                            <div id="indent"><p>I’m a mother-baby nurse at UofL. I’ve been a nurse for seven years.</p></div>
                            <p>Do you consider yourself tech savvy? Or a novice user?</p>
                            <div id="indent"><p>Mildly - I can do basic technical “functions” like using laptops and smartphones proficiently. I’m very good at Googling things and can figure out most issues on my own.</p></div>
                            <p>Do you own a PC? Smart phone?</p>
                            <div id="indent"><p>Yes, and yes.</p></div>
                            <div id="indent"><p>Computer: MacBook Pro – “It’s a leftover from college that I still use every day. I love how simple Apple products are.”</p></div>
                            <div id="indent"><p>Phone: iPhone 14 Pro Max – “I just got it!”</p></div>
                            <p>Do you often interact with apps?</p>
                            <div id="indent"><p>Yes, every day. At work, I use a ton of apps – Epic (for patient info.), Kronos 
                                (for timekeeping), Outlook (general email), TigerConnect (secure IM), Slack (for general message boards). 
                                At home, in my</p></div> <div id="indent"><p>personal life, I use: banking apps like Venmo and PNC, social media 
                                apps like TikTok, Facebook, Instagram, fitness apps like MyFitnessPal and Planet Fitness, I also use Podcasts, email, weather, Spotify,</p></div> 
                                <div id="indent"><p>YouTube, coupon apps, individual store apps. Oh, and, I also use streaming apps a lot like Netflix, Hulu, Philo, and HBO.”</p></div>
                            <p>What does a typical day look like when booking an appointment?</p>
                            <div id="indent"><p>“First thing I do is check the calendar app on my phone, and it depends on what service I’m
                                looking for to figure out how far in advance I need to book.</p></div> <div id="indent"><p>For example, if I just got my hair done, 
                                    I normally book an appointment before I leave for three months out. For my dentist, I set it for six months out.”</p></div>
                            <p>How often do you book appointments ahead of time?</p>
                            <div id="indent"><p>“Depends on the service. If it’s a hair appointment, or grooming appointment for my dog, I like to book it normally at
                                 least three months out. For dentists, every six months. For doctors, two weeks. Car</p></div> <div id="indent"><p>maintenance 
                                 is normally week-of or day-of depending on the situation. For vet appointments, normally between 1-2 weeks out.”</p></div>
                            <p>What features do you look for in an appointment scheduler app?</p>
                            <div id="indent"><p>“I don’t want to have to enter in a bunch of information before I’m able to see availability. I want to be able to glance at
                                 it, book, and go. I also like having a variety of options to pick from, like viewing 
                                 </p></div> <div id="indent"><p>services my stylist provides and all of her prices. Same goes for the nail salon I go to. I also like being 
                                 able to cancel and reschedule if something comes up.”</p></div>
                            <p>How far out in a calendar would you like to see appointment availability?</p>
                            <div id="indent"><p>“For just a general overview, I think the standard needs to be three months. I don’t think anyone really plans anything out further than three months.”</p></div>
                            <p>Would you like to be able to cancel appointments sooner than 24 hours in advance?</p>
                            <div id="indent"><p>“I think it would be necessary because nine times out of ten when you reschedule, it is at least a week before.”</p></div>
                            <p>Would you like to see a list of available providers?</p>
                            <div id="indent"><p>“Yes. For European Wax Center, it shows you all of the estheticians that work there so you can 
                                pick based on who’s available at what time when you need to schedule the appointment.”</p></div>
                            <p>How do you normally access appointment booking? Website? App?</p>
                            <div id="indent"><p>“phone was out of space – which is why I literally just got a new one.”</p></div>
                            <p>Do you often look for a feature that is hard to find?</p>
                            <div id="indent"><p>“Sometimes it can be a little hard to figure out where to change, or cancel, your appointment. I feel like 
                                they hide it on purpose so that I get hit with a cancellation fee. I also like when apps have Face ID and</p></div> <div id="indent"><p>let me prepay.”</p></div>
                            <p>How would you describe your past experience with appointment scheduling apps/websites?</p>
                            <div id="indent"><p>“If a website is super un-user friendly, or overly complicated, I’m quick to give up and just call. I notice that with smaller companies it 
                                seems to be more common. There’s definitely an aesthetic-gap between</p></div> <div id="indent"><p>large companies and smaller ones when I use their websites. 
                                    I also HATE having to complete the I am not a robot test that some websites make you do. And put that IN ALL CAPS IN YOUR INTERVIEW</p></div> <div id="indent"><p>quote!”</p></div>
                            <p>What do you currently like about the product idea? Dislike?</p>
                            <div id="indent"><p>“I like the name – it’s cute. It sounds like Bookee will be super simple and user-friendly. And also, make sure you DON’T put in the I am not a robot test.”</p></div>
                            <p>Would you like reminders sent to you? How many?</p></div>
                            <div id="indent"><p>“Definitely. My ADHD brain needs appointment reminders.”</p></div>
                            <div id="indent"><p>“One the week before. And one the night/day before.”</p></div>
