                            <p><strong>Walter - Scenario 1</strong></p>
                            <p>
                            <div id="indent">Walter wants to schedule a follow up appointment with his orthopedic surgeon, due to his recent knee surgery. But he really needs to be able to alert his support system in an efficient manner that he has</div> <div id="indent">scheduled an appointment so he can identify who can transport him, as he is unable to drive. Due to his ongoing health issues Walter feels like he is always scheduling appointments and then having to</div> <div id="indent">reach out to the numerous members of his support system one by one to see who can transport him. In addition to this process being quite laborious for a man his age, he is also worried that he is</div> <div id="indent">overwhelming his support system and is afraid they will stop taking his phone calls as he fears they think that is the only reason he is calling. Logging onto the Bookee website for the first time Walter</div> <div id="indent">is prompted to sign in with his Gmail account. Walter hopes one day Bookee will allow him to use biometrics to log in as he finds remembering passwords tedious. Since this is his first-time logging into</div> <div id="indent">Bookee it proceeds to ask Walter a series of questions to setup his preferences. One of these questions is if Walter wishes to notify or include other people to his scheduled appointments. By clicking “Yes”,</div> <div id="indent">Bookee then asks Walter if it can have access to his contacts, which Walter agrees too. A prompt then appears which informs Walter that any contact he selects will be added to his Bookee Buddees list.</div> <div id="indent">And that he will have the option to notify all or any of his Buddees when he schedules an appointment. His Buddees will receive a commmunication that contains a link to his Bookee page which displays</div> <div id="indent">his appointment details and prompts the Buddee to select their availability to attend. Walter will then receive confirmation via his preferred communication methods of who can attend his appointment with</div> <div id="indent">him. Walter will also be able to access this information from his BOOKEE page.</div>

                            <p><strong>Walter - Scenario 2</strong></p>
                            <p>
                            <div id="indent">Walter recently felt dizzy after getting out of the shower and fell. Thankfully due to him residing in a senior living community he had an easy way to contact staff who came and assisted with getting him back</div> <div id="indent">on his feet and an onsite nurse checked his vitals to make sure he was okay. He was given a clean bill of health but was directed by the nurse to go see his PCP as soon as possible in case this dizzy spell</div> <div id="indent">was medication related or a sign of a different condition. Walter promptly signed into his Bookee account and selected his PCP from his list of saved providers. He was reminded by Bookee upon selecting</div> <div id="indent">his PCP that he already has an appointment scheduled with them, but it was two months away and if he would like to look to schedule anyway? Upon selecting “Yes” his PCP’s scheduling page appeared</div> <div id="indent">onto the screen. Unfortunately, all Walter saw was greyed out days and times slots due to those appointments being bookee’d already. This was true for the entire next month. This worried Walter because</div> <div id="indent">if he got dizzy and fell again his living community by policy would take him to the emergency room if he hasn’t seen his PCP since the first dizzy episode. But in the bottom right corner of the Bookee</div> <div id="indent">scheduling screen Walter saw a question prompt which read “Don’t see an appointment you like?” Walter clicked on the link and a prompt screen appeared asking Walter if he would like to be notified of</div> <div id="indent">any cancelations for this provider that occur before his next scheduled appointment. Walter selected “Yes.” A few days later Walter received a notification on his phone, a cancelation had occurred at his</div> <div id="indent">PCP’s office, and he could click on the notification to be taken to the scheduling screen. Walter clicked on the notification and he was promptly logged into his Bookee account and taken to his PCP’s</div> <div id="indent">scheduling page to the date and time slot now available. Bookee prompted Walter if he would like to accept this new appointment and cancel his previously scheduled one. Walter clicked on “Yes.” He</div> <div id="indent">quickly received another notification this time alerting him that he had just cancelled his previous appointment and scheduled for the new date and time.</div>

                            <p><strong>Walter - Scenario 3</strong></p>
                            <p>
                            <div id="indent">Walter’s children surprise him one Sunday morning by picking him up for a day trip back to his hometown of Winchester, KY. They have a great day driving around their old hometown, checking out the old</div> <div id="indent">sites and new attractions. But unfortunately, as they are getting ready to head back home his son’s car gets a flat tire. They put the spare on the car, but it is not rated for highway travel so until they can get</div> <div id="indent">the original tire patched or get a new one, they won’t be able to drive on the interstate. Having not lived in Winchester for several years and it being a Sunday the family isn’t sure where they can get the tire</div> <div id="indent">fixed. Walter wanting to impress his children quickly logs into his Bookee account using his Gmail account. On his homepage he selects the tab “add provider/service,” a drop-down menu appears that</div> <div id="indent">allows him to chose from a list of generic and specific service providers. He finds Mechanic on the list and selects it by clicking on it. This brings up a prompt that asks if he would like to look up providers by</div> <div id="indent">“name” or providers in his area. Walter chooses “area” which then prompts him to enter in his location, which he does, Winchester, KY. This takes him to a new screen which lists all the Mechanics in</div> <div id="indent">Winchester, KY. that use Bookee for their scheduling needs. This screen also has a filtering option which allows Walter to refine his search to Mechanics with the soonest availability. This refined search </div> <div id="indent">results in Walter being able to schedule an appointment at Mike’s Mechanic shop at 4pm today and the shop happens to only be 3 miles away.</div>
