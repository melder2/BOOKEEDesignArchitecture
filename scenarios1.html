                            <div id="indent">Sherry has noticed a common complaint amongst her patients lately
                            – they’ve all needed to schedule follow-up appointments, or alter
                            existing ones, but can only do so if it’s during normal business
                            hours</div> <div id="indent">when she’s able to look at her pen & paper planner. She tells
                            her patients that she is switching over to a new, digital appointment
                            scheduling application, called Bookee, that will allow them to view
                            available</div> <div id="indent">timeslots 24/7. After providing a brief overview, the patients
                            are able to go home and schedule follow-ups at their leisure. Additionally,
                            some patients find that last-minute emergencies come up in their</div> <div id="indent">everyday
                            lives and they have no choice but to cancel appointments. However, they
                            despise the hospital’s cancellation policy - which charges a fee for any
                            cancelled, previously scheduled appointment. Sherry</div> <div id="indent">is able to calm her
                            patients’ added anxiety by telling them that Bookee allows free cancellation
                            for any appointment, up to 24 hours in advance.</div>

                            <p><strong>Sherry - Scenario 2</strong></p>

                            <div id="indent">Sherry has been approached by Larry, a new colleague, and recent graduate, in
                            the psychology department of the hospital where she works and asked how she’s
                            able to juggle so many patients back-to-back</div> <div id="indent">throughout the day. Larry wants to
                            make sure that he has enough of a gap between patient sessions tofinalize his
                            notes and recollect himself before seeing the next patient. Previously, Larry
                            used pen & paper</div> <div id="indent">to keep track of his schedule but finds it too easy to accidentally
                            cause overlap and conflicting appointments. Sherry helps Larry register to Bookee
                            with a unique user ID and begin importing his current day’s</div> <div id="indent">schedule. She learns
                            that Larry would like a color-coding system that displays if a patient is a referral,
                            established, or new. Sherry then shows him that Bookee allows each timeslot to be
                            highlighted in three</div> <div id="indent">different colors.</div>

                            <p><strong>Sherry - Scenario 3</strong></p>

                            <div id="indent">Sherry has been asked by Rodney, the head of the Psychology department in her hospital,
                            to test pilot Bookee for managing her patient’s appointments. Rodney wants to make sure
                            that healthcare providers</div> <div id="indent">will be able to easily view their upcoming appointments in
                            daily, weekly, and monthly views. Sherry begins by adding all of her day’s appointments
                            to Bookee to give an overview of the work ahead. She </div> <div id="indent">selects different timeslots to see
                            the name of the patient scheduled and their most recent session notes. She asked colleagues
                            if there were any features they’d like to see most in Bookee, and the consensus</div> <div id="indent">was a “streamlined interface.”</div>
