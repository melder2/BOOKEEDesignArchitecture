                            <br><p><strong>Database -</strong> Bookee will utilize a relational SQL database using MySQL. Since our product focuses on the relationship between customers and providers a relational database not only makes functional sense but will also provide the opportunity to run queries on that data to produce viable feedback on how users are interacting with Bookee but also provide feedback to providers that can help them better serve their customers.</p>

                            <p><strong>Platform- </strong>Web-based. Flexibility is key when it comes to using Bookee. It will be used in a variety of settings, including home, workplace and school, by a variety of users including customers and providers, on a variety of machines, including desktop, tablet and mobile devices. Therefore, Bookee will be best utilized as a web-based application that can run on all browsers.</p>

                            <p><strong>Server - </strong>Initially, Bookee will utilize a smaller scale cloud-service provider. This will provide Bookee with the low-overhead and flexibility necessary for a small startup application to hit the ground running. If Bookee can gain a foothold in the marketplace, especially in the medical field, then switching to one of the “big three” cloud providers or investing in custom servers would have to occur not only to ensure reliability of services for our users, but also to ensure safety of our data as it will most likely contain HIPPA protected information. The server will also be the one reused component in our application as it will act as the liaison between all other components. </p>

                            <p><strong>Open-Source –</strong>Bookee will take advantage of several open-source products at its inception to keep overhead costs down and help get it to market sooner.  This includes using Nodejs for its runtime execution, Docker as its container, and MySQL for database management.</p>

                            <p><strong>Development Tools –</strong> Bookee will be programmed using html, CSS, JavaScript and use MySQL to build and operate its database.  The development team behind Bookee has experience utilizing all these development tools. This will limit the learning curve needed by the team to create a functional application, while also allowing for all team members to assist with its development.</p><br>
