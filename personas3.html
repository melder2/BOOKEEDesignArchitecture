                            Walter, age 81, is a retired school superintendent  of a mid-size county school system. Born and raised in Winchester, KY. he left home right after high school to join the Navy. After serving out his enlistment, he retired from the Navy and used his GI bill to attend college at the University of Kentucky, where he received his teaching degree and met and married his wife, Earlene. Upon graduation, they moved back to Winchester where they raised their 4 children, 3 boys and 1 girl. Walter steadily worked his way up from a high school Science teacher to Principal and eventually became the superintendent of their school district. Upon retiring 10 years ago, he and his wife set out traveling the world before settling in Louisville, KY. where most of his children and now grandchildren reside. Unfortunately, his wife Earlene passed away two years ago and due to his declining abilities to take care of himself, especially after requiring hip and knee surgeries. He resides in a retirement community that provides staffing to help him get his needs and wants met, especially for transportation as Walter can no longer drive.

                            Walter has always been a big proponent of technology and incorporating into his life and work. As a superintendent, he secured funding to ensure every classroom in his district had computers that were connected to high-speed internet. He likes to consider himself tech savvy and used to buy the latest gadgets and toys. He still boasts that he was the first person in Winchester to have a VHS player. Today, he uses a Tablet and iPhone to communicate with his family, he especially likes to face time with his grandkids. He also uses them to pay his bills and makes appointments through various websites and apps. He is interested in using Bookie as he is hopeful it can provide a one-stop shop for scheduling all his various appointments, as he sees multiple medical providers due to his on-going health issues.
