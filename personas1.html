                            Sherry, age 59, is a psychologist for a large, local hospital. She specializes
                            in early childhood development and attention-deficit disorders. She was born in
                            Glasgow, KY where her father owned a chain of apartment complexes while her mother
                            stayed home to raise their eight children. After earning  numerous degrees in the
                            field of medicine, with an emphasis in psychology, from the University of Kentucky,
                            she moved to Louisville to be with her newlywed husband to start a family and begin
                            treating patients. She has two children: a son aged 31 and a daughter, aged 35. Her
                            son is a Software Engineer for a startup company, and her daughter is an insurance
                            agent specializing in home coverage. Sherry likes to get home as early as possible
                            from the office so that she can pick up her grandkids from school and spoil them with
                            desserts before dinner.

                            Sherry uses a popular calendar organization application to keep track of her patient’s
                            appointments but sometimes finds the app to be overwhelming with all of its features
                            and customizations. She does not consider herself “tech-savvy” and misses the days of
                            “good ‘ol pen & paper” for keeping track of her patients’ schedules. She loathes the
                            telemedicine environment and avoids its use if at all possible – she prefers face-to-face
                            interactions with her patients because she believes “it builds trust.” She’s open to
                            using Bookee for her primary appointment scheduling application if it was “user-friendly
                            and simple.” However, she is not interested in viewing estimated parking costs or related
                            features if offered.
