                            <p>Do you consider yourself tech savvy? Or a novice user? </p>

                            <div id="indent"><p>Higher level novice</p></div>

                            <p>What does a typical day look like when booking an appointment? </p>

                            <div id="indent"><p>I try to call early to book early morning appointments 
                                when businesses first open to have more available options. If online or an app, I do it as soon as the need arises. </p></div>

                            <p>Do you own a PC? Smart phone? </p>

                            <div id="indent"><p>No, but I own an iPad and iPhone 13</p></div>

                            <p>How often do you book appointments ahead of time? </p>

                            <div id="indent"><p>I book up to a year for a doctor appointment. My doctor has options for both online and calling to make
                                 appointment. I book up to six months for a dentist, and I have to call to make the appointment. I book</p></div> <div id="indent">services around
                                  the home such as plumbing, yard work, and electricians up to two weeks, and I usually have to call. I book a haircut
                                   two months out, and I have to call. </p></div>

                            <p>What features do you look for in an appointment scheduler? </p>

                            <div id="indent"><p>I look for immediate notification of the appointment and reminder</p></div>

                            <p>How far out in a calendar would you like to see appointment availability? </p>

                            <div id="indent"><p>Depends for different services.</p>
                            <p>Dr. – 1 year and 2 months</p>
                            <p>Dental – 8 months</p>

                            <p>Massage – 3 months</p>
                            <p>Plumber – 3 weeks to a month</p></div>


                            <p>Would you like to be able to cancel appointments sooner than 24 hours in advance?</p>

                            <div id="indent"><p>Yes, I would like to be able to cancel appointments sooner than 24 hours in advance.</p></div>


                            <p>Would you like to see a list of available providers?</p>

                            <div id="indent"><p>Yes, I think it would be helpful to see a list of available providers.</p></div>

                            <p>How do you normally access appointment booking? Website? App?</p>

                            <div id="indent"><p>I normally use websites and more frequent appointments I make the appointments using apps. I prefer to make appointments online or on an app by far, but some I call if there is no other option.</p></div>

                            <p>Do you often look for a feature that is hard to find?</p>

                            <div id="indent"><p>No, the features are usually straight forward.</p></div>

                            <p>How would you describe your past experience with appointment scheduling apps?</p>

                            <div id="indent"><p>I would say that apps make the process much easier than calling, faster appointment booking, and more private.
                                 It also gives more time to think and decide on an appointment time, so you don’t get put on</p></div> <div id="indent"><p>the spot.</p></div>

                            <p>What do you currently like about the product? Dislike?</p>

                            <div id="indent"><p>I like that the appointments are in a grid style, easy to see all the appointment availability, and the reminders and immediate confirmation.</p></div>

                            <p>Would you like reminders sent to you? How many?</p>

                            <div id="indent"><p>Yes, I like reminders and I think 1 is good.</p></div>

                            <p>When would you like the reminders sent to you? How would you like them sent you (ex. Text)?</p>

                            <div id="indent"><p>I would prefer the reminder 2 days prior, so it gives me time to plan if there is an issue. I like texts to remind you of appointments and a question about confirmation.</p></div>

                            <p>Would you use an appointment scheduler app if there was one available for various appointments?</p>

                            <div id="indent"><p>Yes, I would definitely use that over calling.</p></div>

                            <p>When do you think the latest you can cancel an appointment be without a penalty?</p>

                            <div id="indent"><p>I think the latest you should be able to cancel an appointment without penalty should be 24 hours.</p></div>

                            <p>Do you think there should be any down time for the app such as use only during business hours?</p>

                            <div id="indent"><p>No</p></div>


                            <p>What is one word that describes this appointment scheduler?</p>

                            <div id="indent"><p>Helpful</p></div>
