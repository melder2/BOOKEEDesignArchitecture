                            John, age 58, is an orthopedic surgeon at Louisville Orthopedics Clinic in Louisville, KY. He primarily works on people with knee and shoulder injuries. He was born in Louisville, KY where his father was a doctor and his mother was a homemaker. After completing his medical degree at UofL, he stayed in Louisville because all of his friends and family were there. He currently has two children, aged 18 and 21, who both attend UofL. He likes to spend time with his family whenever he can because of his busy work schedule.
                            John doesn’t use any social media platform and relies on news and different information from the TV. He currently books appointments only by phone calls and his receptionists write the appointments down manually. He is open to a simple appointment booking scheduler that will make everyone’s lives earlier including his, his receptionists, and his patients. He will primarily use the appointment booking software to view upcoming appointment and also determine what the appointment is regarding.
