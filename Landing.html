            <h3><strong>Description</strong></h3>
            <P>This product is an appointment booking system that provides any user an easy way 
              of booking appointments online for service providers such as tire shops, medical or 
              dental providers, etc. This is an application that overcomes the issue of managing 
              and booking appointments according to the user’s demands. The task sometimes becomes
               very difficult for service providers to manually manage appointments. This product
                offers an effective solution - allowing users to view, and reserve, different available
                 time slots throughout the day. Currently reserved appointment slots will be marked light
                  blue and will not be available for selection. Users will also be able to cancel their 
                  appointment anytime up to 24 hours in advance.
