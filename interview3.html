                                4 computers in my classroom. Two students taught me a lot about computers due to their parents</p></div> <div id="indent"><p>working with computers.</p></div>

                            <p>Do you own a PC? Smart phone?</p>

                            <div id="indent"><p>Yes, I do that often.</p></div>

                            <p>Do you book appointments online?</p>
                            <div id="indent"><p>I did for the covid shot, I help my sisters book appointments. And I see them text with their doctors a lot. I have access through
                                 Medicare to setup appointments but don’t take advantage of it. And I schedule</p></div> <div id="indent"><p>Grocery pickup with Krogers on their app</p></div>

                            <p>How often do you book appointments ahead of time?</p>

                            <div id="indent"><p>I do weekly pickups with Krogers, and schedule payments monthly</p></div>

                            <p>What does a typical day look like when booking an appointment?</p>

                            <div id="indent"><p>I’m already mentally prepared for what days I like to book things and I know what days to go online to find those appointments.</p></div>

                            <p>How would you describe your past experience with appointment scheduling apps?</p>

                            <div id="indent"><p>Mostly for grocery shopping, scheduling grocery pickup, helping my sister’s make doctor’s appointments</p></div>

                            <p>What features do you like in an appointment scheduler?</p>

                            <div id="indent"><p>When it keeps my data about what and when I have scheduled for in the past, so it’s just a click away to chose what I want.</p></div>

                            <p>How far out in a calendar would you like to see appointment availability?</p>

                            <div id="indent"><p>As long as I can see available appointments I’m fine.</p></div>

                            <p>Would you like to be able to cancel appointments sooner than 24 hours in advance?</p>

                            <div id="indent"><p>I try to never schedule something that I can’t make, I would like the option to call if something comes up within 24 hours.</p></div>

                            <p>Would you like to see a list of available providers you can schedule with?</p>

                            <div id="indent"><p>I guess that could be helpful</p></div>

                            <p>How do you normally access appointment booking? Website? App?</p>

                            <div id="indent"><p>Website, app, both I guess.</p></div>

                            <p>Do you often look for a feature that is hard to find with apps you like to use?</p>

                            <div id="indent"><p>Yes, talk to text</p></div>

                            <p>What do you currently like about the application you use the most? </p>

                            <div id="indent"><p>The Kroger app I like a lot. I like being able to use my finger print to verify scheduling. The more secure the better.</p></div>

                            <p>Dislike?</p>

                            <div id="indent"><p>If I forget something I have a time limit to go back and add, and then the charges are separate on my back account.</p></div>

                            <p>Would you like reminders sent to you?</p>

                            <div id="indent"><p>I really like reminders, I think my memory is good. I live alone so I don’t have someone to remind me of things. 
                                I like texts the best because notifications can go away. But I do like notifications as well.</p></div>

                            <p>How many reminders would you like to receive?</p>

                            <div id="indent"><p>Not too many, I like to choose my preferences to how many I receive, and how I receive them.</p></div>

                            <p>Any features that would you like to see incorporated into scheduling applications?</p>

                            <div id="indent"><p>Ease of use. At my age it can be difficult to move my fingers and touch things, so I like to use talk to text. That would be nice to be able to use that to schedule.</p></div>

                            <p>Other features you like?</p>

                            <div id="indent"><p>I like getting notification sent to my smart watch.</p></div>
